        <h3> What We Do</h3>
        <p> Reactive and complex fluids have enormous applications in the oil and gas industry ranging from flow assurance, well-stimulation, water control, drilling fluids to enhanced oil recovery at reservoir scale. The challenging reservoir conditions of high salinity, high temperature, and high pressure combined with reservoir heterogeneity introduce a high-degree of uncertainty in treatment design, reservoir monitoring, and large-scale modeling. Our attempt in the “Reactive and Complex Fluids Lab” at KFUPM is addressing issues of reaction kinetics, diffusion, interfacial phenomena, and phase changes associated with applications of reactive fluids (acids, emulsified acids) and complex fluids (viscoelastic surfactant, gels, foam, emulsion) in real reservoir condition. Our lab is driven by local challenges of hydrocarbon fields in Saudi Arabia and the MENA region. The CRF Research Lab has good facilities that include but not limited to: rotating disk reactor (150°C, 10,000 psi), TA high-pressure Rheometer (250°C, 2000 psi), light scattering, microscope, Acidizing System (3 parallel cores 12 in each, 150°C, 10,000 psi) in addition to other accessible facilities at the Department of Petroleum Engineering and Center for Integrative Petroleum Research.</p>

            <h3> CRF RESEARCH</h3>
            <p>Reactive and complex fluids have enormous applications in the oil and gas industry ranging from well stimulation, water control, drilling fluids in near wellbore to enhanced oil recovery at reservoir scale. The challenging reservoir conditions of high salinity, high temperature, and high pressure combined with reservoir heterogeneity introduce a high-degree of uncertainty in treatment design, reservoir monitoring, and large-scale modeling. In the past few years at KFUPM, I carried out a number of experimental and theoretical projects in various areas related to oilfield chemicals and as a result, established my research lab at KFUPM under the title “Reactive and Complex Fluids’ Lab”.Our attempt in the “RCF Research lab is to address issues of reaction kinetics, diffusion, interfacial phenomena, and phase changes associated with applications of reactive fluids (acids, emulsified acids) and complex fluids (viscoelastic surfactant, gels, foam, emulsion) in real reservoir condition. Our lab is driven by local challenges of hydrocarbon fields in Saudi Arabia. The RCF Research Lab has good facilities that include but not limited to: rotating disk reactor (150°C, 10,000 psi), TA high-pressure Rheometer (250°C, 2000 psi), light scattering, microscope, Acidizing System (3 parallel cores 12 in each, 150°C, 10,000 psi) in addition to other accessible facilities at the Department of Petroleum Engineering and Center for Petroleum & Minerals. Most of the research outcomes have been published in reputable journals and conference proceedings. A brief summary of my research work with the highlight of active projects is listed below.</p>
